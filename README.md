## SpanNER: Named EntityRe-/Recognition as Span Prediction

This repository contains the code for our paper [SpanNER: Named EntityRe-/Recognition as Span Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00641v1.pdf).

The model designed in this work has been deployed into [ExplainaBoard](http://explainaboard.nlpedia.ai/leaderboard/task-ner/index.php).

## Overview

We investigate complementary advantages of systems based on different paradigms: span prediction model and sequence labeling framework. We then reveal that span prediction, simultaneously, can serve as a system combiner to re-recognize named entities from different systemsâ€™ outputs. We experimentally implement 154 systems on 11
datasets, covering three languages, comprehensive results show the effectiveness of span prediction models that both serve as base NER systems and system combiners.

<!-- Two roles of span prediction models (boxes in blue): 
* as a base NER system 
* as a system combiner. -->

## Requirements

- `python3`
- `PyTorch`
- `pytorch-lightning`

Run the following script to install the dependencies,
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`



## Data Preprocessing

The dataset needs to be preprocessed, before running the model.
We provide `dataprocess/bio2spannerformat.py` for reference, which gives the CoNLL-2003 as an example. 
First, you need to download datasets, and then convert them into BIO2 tagging format. We provided the CoNLL-2003 dataset with BIO format in `data/conll03_bio`, and its preprocessed format dataset `data/conll03`.

The download links of the datasets used in this work are shown as follows:
- [CoNLL-2003](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/)
- [CoNLL-2002](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2002/ner/)
- [OntoNotes 5.0](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19)
- [WNUT-2016](http://noisy-text.github.io/2016/ner-shared-task.html)
- [WNUT-2017](http://noisy-text.github.io/2017/emerging-rare-entities.html)



## Prepare Models

For English Datasets, we use [BERT-Large](https://github.com/google-research/bert)
For Dutch and Spanish Datasets, we use [BERT-Multilingual-Base](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-uncased)






## How to run?

Here, we give CoNLL-2003 as an example. You may need to change the `DATA_DIR`, `PRETRAINED`, `dataname`, `n_class` to your own dataset path, pre-trained model path, dataset name, and the number of labels in the dataset, respectively.

`./run_conll03_spanner.sh`



## System Combination

### Base Model
We provided 12 base model result-files of CoNLL-2003 dataset in `combination/results`.
More base model's result-files can be download from [ExplainaBoard-download](http://explainaboard.nlpedia.ai/download.html).

### Combination
Put your result-files with different models in `data/results` folder, then run:

`python comb_voting.py`. 

Here, we provided four system combination methods, including: SpanNER, Majority voting (VM), Weighted voting base on overall F1-score (VOF1), Weighted voting base on class F1-score (VCF1).
