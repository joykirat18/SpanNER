## SpanNER: Named EntityRe-/Recognition as Span Prediction

This repository contains the code for our paper [SpanNER: Named EntityRe-/Recognition as Span Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00641v1.pdf).

### Overview

We investigate complementary advantages of systems based on different paradigms: span prediction model and sequence labeling framework. We then reveal that span prediction, simultaneously, can serve as a system combiner to re-recognize named entities from different systemsâ€™ outputs. We experimentally implement 154 systems on 11
datasets, covering three languages, comprehensive results show the effectiveness of span prediction models that both serve as base NER systems and system combiners.

<!-- Two roles of span prediction models (boxes in blue): 
* as a base NER system 
* as a system combiner. -->
